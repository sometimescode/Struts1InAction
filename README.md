# Struts1InAction
All over again.

Chapter 3
1. Created a copy of Tomcat's servlet to relevant jdk's path according to responses found below:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9193228/compile-error-package-javax-servlet-does-not-exist
This fixed ant not building. It builds now.
2. In VSCODE, under JAVA PROJECTS, you can add libraries that vscode should be able to recognize. 
This fixes red underline issues. (Reference your project's struts.jar and tomcat's common\lib\servlet.jar).
